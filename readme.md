Hello Team, Here I create a Project based on given assignment.


1. Created Project using terminal `react-native init JetDevs` github link JetDevs :: `https://github.com/janak-gloify/jetdevs`
2. Folder and Development structure not defined in React Native official document, but based on my knowledge and experience, i am 
going with below structure.
- Files name starts with Uppercase letter.
- Comments wherever required.
- Common styles based on the requirements

        |
        |
        |__ assets
        |
        |__ components ( customised / repeated components )
        |
        |__ redux
        |       |
        |       |__ actions
        |       |
        |       |__ reducers
        |
        |__ router / navigations
        |
